1. Missing API specification
To test the new endpoint, the following information is required but not provided in the assignment:
- Base URL and endpoint paths
- Supported HTTP methods
- Request and response schemas
- Error handling and status codes

Due to the absence of a formal API contract, API interaction is mocked conceptually, and the core business logic is tested directly;
but added a reference to a fictitious endpoint in some places for example

2. Service charge calculation
The assignment states that a 10% service charge is applied to food.
Assumption: The service charge applies to the final bill for all items. It is calculated after discounts and before rounding.

3. “Drinks have a 30% discount when ordered before 19:00”
Not specified:
- is condition strict < 19:00 or <= 19:00;
- if the order is partial how the time for each item is stored
Assumption: 
19:00 is the cutoff time after which the discount no longer applies.
The discount is determined individually for each item based on its order time, not the time of the entire order. 

4. Meaning of “a group of X people”
The scenarios repeatedly mention “a group of X people”, however no requirement states that the number of people affects pricing or calculation logic.
Assumption: The number of people does not affect the order calculation and is not sent to the API. Only the ordered items influence the bill total.

5. Missing order time in Scenario 1
Scenario 1 does not specify the order time, which is critical due to time-based drink discounts.
Assumption:
Two test cases are created:
A. Order placed before 19:00 (drink discount applies)
B. Order placed after 19:00 (no drink discount)

6. Missing order time in Scenario 3
Scenario 3 does not specify the time when the order update (cancellation) occurs.
Assumption:
By analogy with Scenario 2, it is assumed that the order update occurs after 20:00.

7. Ambiguous wording in Scenario 3
The phrase “A group of 4 people order a starter, 1 mains and a drink each” is ambiguous.
Assumption:
Each person orders 1 starter + 1 main + 1 drink
Resulting in a total of: 4 starters + 4 mains + 4 drinks
